# Sensor Data Graphing
## C# Companion Application for Senior Design 2015-2016

This application was used for a graphical representation of the data that was saved from our sensors to an SD card. This is great to determine trends and random occurrences.

This is my first attempt at a C# application so the code is a little rough and some parts are hard coded to work.
